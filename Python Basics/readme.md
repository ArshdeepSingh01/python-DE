# Why python for Data Engineering?
Python is extensively used in data engineering for various tasks like data ingestion, transformation, and loading, as well as for building and orchestrating data pipelines. Its rich ecosystem of libraries like Pandas and NumPy, combined with its readability and ease of use, make it a popular choice for data engineers. 

# Strings
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

# Numbers 
There are three numeric types in Python:
**int** - Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
**float** -Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10. Like 35e10
**complex** - Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
Example
x = 3+5j


# Lists
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
List items are **ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate** values.

It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.
