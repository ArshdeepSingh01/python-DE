# Why python for Data Engineering?
Python is extensively used in data engineering for various tasks like data ingestion, transformation, and loading, as well as for building and orchestrating data pipelines. Its rich ecosystem of libraries like Pandas and NumPy, combined with its readability and ease of use, make it a popular choice for data engineers. 

# Strings
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
